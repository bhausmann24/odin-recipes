    <h1>Lembas Bread</h1>

    <h3>Elven Lembas Bread. One small bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown man!</h3>
    <p>Lembas was made first by Yavanna from special corn that grew in <em>Aman</em>, and OromÃ« gave it to the Elves of the Great Journey.</p>
    <p>Only on rare occasions was it given to non-Elves, because it was believed that mortals who ate it would become wary of their mortality and would desire to live among the Elves. Let us hope a similar fate does not befall the souls who follow this recipe.</p>

    <h3>Traditional Homemade Corned Beef Hash</h3>
    <p>The British invented the term “corned beef” in the 17th century to describe the size of the salt crystals used to cure the meat, the size of corn kernels. Although history traces the advent of corned beef hash on American soil to the 19th-century Ashkenazi Jews, the classic American corned beef hash is credited to New England residents in the United States who saw the meal as a means to use up leftovers from dinner.</p>
    <p>It's a versatile meal that pairs well with eggs, making it a fantastic brunch, breakfast, or dinner option everyone will love!</p>

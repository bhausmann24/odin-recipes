    <h3>Brazilian Fish Stew <em>(Moqueca)</em></h3>
    <p>Moqueca is a stew, usually based on fish and/or seafood, seasoned with various herbs and peppers. Moqueca is a dish that uniquely expresses the various cultures that formed the Brazilian people. Its origin is the result of indigenous, African, and Portuguese influences, mixing techniques and ingredients from several continents in an authentically national dish.</p>
    <p>There are two types of Moqueca in Brazil from two different states in Brazil. One is from Bahia (in the northeast of the country) called Moqueca Baiana. The other one is from Espirito Santo (in southeastern Brazil) called Moqueca Capixaba. The difference between them is the Moqueca Baiana uses palm oil and coconut milk and Moqueca Capixaba uses olive oil and tomato broth.</p>
